            <h3>Accommodations</h3>
            <div>
              <p>One of the things we’re most excited about is to share our Portland home with you… this city has so much to offer and so many neighborhoods to explore! We are not reserving a block of rooms at any one hotel in the city, but we want to support you in finding somewhere fun and affordable to stay.</p>
              <p>Most of our family members and friends with reservations so far have found great options on <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank">Airbnb</a> ($50+). There are a ridiculous number of fun neighborhoods, each with something to offer. Some things to keep in mind:
                <ul>
                  <li>The Northeast will put you in closest proximity to our wedding venue and to the airport. Anywhere within a few blocks of Alberta Street<span class="special">**</span> (from approximately 10th to 30th) is in walking distance from lots of fun quirky shops, plus many bars and restaurants. Further north towards our home and venue will be slightly less gentrified overall, shifting to industrial as you approach Columbia Blvd. Our venue is in a pocket of fun stuff known as Woodlawn/Dekum Triangle, nestled in solidly residential neighborhood.</li>
                  <li>The Southeast is riddled with fun, hipster corridors&mdash; Hawthorne and Division<span class="special">**</span>  streets perhaps most notable among them.</li>
                  <li>North Portland’s most well-known area is North Mississippi Avenue: a good bar scene, some iconic Portland establishments, and dare we say great donuts.</li>
                  <li>Southwest/Downtown will give you the most “city” feel if that’s your thing and is the home of Portland State’s main campus. These areas (along with Northwest) would put you in closest proximity to the Zoo and Japanese Gardens, and easiest access to the Max’s red line that goes directly to the airport.</li>
                  <li>Northwest’s “the Pearl” and 23rd Avenue<span class="special">**</span>: slightly upscale and super fun for walking around and window-shopping. Like the rest of the city, gorgeous in summer.</li>
                  <li>Vancouver, WA (our neighbors to the north) will be less walkable and have less access to public transit, but likely to have even more affordable options and about 15 minutes from the wedding venue.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p class="ice-cream"><span class="special">**</span> In case ice cream is as important in your decision-making as it is in mine: note that these corridors are all home to Portland’s iconic <a href="http://saltandstraw.com" target="_blank">Salt & Straw</a> ice cream chain. Yes, there will be lines out the door; yes, it is totally socially acceptable to taste ALL the flavors; yes, it will be worth it.</p>
              <p>If you’re looking for a slightly more traditional hotel experience with a Portland twist, might we suggest McMenamin’s or The Ace Hotel:
                <ul>
                  <li><a href="https://www.mcmenamins.com/kennedy-school" target="_blank">The Kennedy School</a> ($230+) is a converted elementary school, which is now mostly themed bars. Guests enjoy complimentary access to their soaking pools and movie theater. Under two miles from the wedding venue.</li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.mcmenamins.com/crystal-hotel" target="_blank">The Crystal Hotel</a> downtown ($175+) also offers access to heated soaking pools (these guys are really into soaking pools!). Note that part of this place’s “charm” is a European-style bathroom-down-the-hall situation.</li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.acehotel.com/portland" target="_blank">The Ace Hotel</a> ($195+) is another that’s so Portland option downtown. Also a private bathroom down the hall situation.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>Looking for a known entity? The <a href="http://www.bwportlandhotel.com" target="_blank">Best Western Inn at the Meadows</a> ($200ish, less for AAA members) is under a ten-minute drive (also read: pretty cheap Lyft) from the wedding venue. Note more limited access to public transit, but still spitting distance from Portland proper.</p>
